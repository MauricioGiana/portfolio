    "description": "Enthusiastic and skilled backend developer with experience in the healthcare technology industry. I have a strong ability to deliver clear and scalable code; and to work proactively in collaborative environments. My work experience allowed me to develop my technical and professional skills under the guidance and support of an excellent work team. Here I was able to gain valuable experience implementing good programming practices, design patterns, architecture, TDD, among others. While I have basic knowledge and experience in front-end development, my passion and primary focus lies on the backend. Among my strengths I could highlight proactivity in searching for solutions, critical vision to identify opportunities for improvement and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively. I am a continuous learner, always willing to expand my knowledge and skills to adapt to the latest technologies and industry trends.",
