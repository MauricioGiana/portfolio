      "description": "I'm an Argentinian developer starting his career in the tech world, thirsty for knowledge and challenges. As a programmer, I really enjoy the logical and functional side, although lately I also enjoy the front-end, so I like being involved in both sides of IT. I have studies in other fields such as Mechanical Technicature and Petroleum Technicature, but I found my true vocation in code, logic, constant learning and the possibility of being in tune with the endless advance of the world and technology. I consider myself ambitious and non-conformist, so I´m always in the constant search to improve both personally and professionally. I am always open to learn from others and offer my help and knowledge to those who need it. I´m also very sociable, I enjoy meeting new people and talking about any topic.",
